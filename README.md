StringExtractor
===============

Write to a file a single line containing the alphabetical characters, followed by the count of alphabetical characters, then the numerical characters, and finally the count of numerical characters, each separated by a comma. For example, given the String “12345ABC”, the file should contain the line “ABC,3,12345,5”.
